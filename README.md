# AES Encryption Implementation  

This project focuses on implementing the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm in Python. The implementation ensures accuracy by referencing reliable sources for both encryption and decryption processes.  

## Features  
- Implementation of AES encryption and decryption.  
- Detailed breakdown of key expansion, mix columns, and other AES components.  
- Validation of encryption results using trusted references.
